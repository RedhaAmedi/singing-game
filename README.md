# ðŸŒ¿ Singing Game (ESP32) (C code)

A small and mindful game where you face a simple challenge: match the frequency of a tone using your voice, a whistle, or another sound source. The board listens. If your voice is true, you win. If not, try again.

This project is implemented on the ESP32 platform using low-level DAC and ADC register manipulation, and it serves both as a game and a study of signal generation, sampling, and interpretation.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

1. The ESP32 generates a pure tone using its internal cosine waveform generator.
2. You listen carefully.
3. You reproduce the tone â€” singing, whistling, humming.
4. The ESP32 samples your sound using an amplified microphone.
5. It detects your frequency and compares it to the one it emitted.
6. A gentle LED informs you whether harmony was achieved.
